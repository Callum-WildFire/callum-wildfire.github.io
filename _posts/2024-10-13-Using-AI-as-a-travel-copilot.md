**Using AI as a travel copilot**

I am currently traveling around Indonesia and Japan. While traveling, I've been experimenting with various AI tools to enhance my travel experience and unlock insights that would have been simply unattainable just a few years ago. The combination of AI capabilities and the natural curiosity of being in a new place has made my adventures feel a lot more intuitive and informed. Here’s how I’ve been using these digital copilots during my travels.

**Tools Used**:

- **ChatGPT**: My go-to for nuanced questions and translations.
- **Perplexity**: Perfect for anything requiring search and quick information.
- **Google Lens**: For identifying objects, translating signs, and real-time image analysis.

I will split this article into two main sections. Firstly, anything requiring search. For example, finding good restaurants nearby, checking the best times to visit a particular tourist spot, understanding the local customs, or even figuring out the best modes of transport available. secondly, 

**For Anything Requiring Search**

When I need quick information about a new city, a historical landmark, or even the best restaurants, Perplexity has been a helpful sidekick. It’s like having an intelligent search engine that’s honed specifically for travelers. Instead of generic answers, I often get more nuanced responses that help me make informed decisions, whether it's choosing between two temples or deciding what local delicacy I want to try first. 

Examples:

1. Finding Resturants. 
2. Finding Landmarks.
3. Finding Things to Do

**Adding Depth and Context**

When I do not need to search but want more details or context, such as translating a menu, identifying what meals are vegetarian for my girlfriend, or getting more information using GPT-4's multimodal capabilities (Where a quick Google lens translation fails), I have found ChatGPT to be invaluable. It provides not just literal translations but also cultural insights, and context-aware interpretations, and even helps me tailor my choices to specific needs, like vegetarian options.

Examples:

1. Translation with Context 

   I carry a Google Pixel phone, which comes with Google Lens — a fantastic app for quick translations of signs and menus. But there’s a limit to how well it performs, especially with poorly written signs, handwritten menus, or regional dialects. As I've been traveling around Indonesia, I’ve run into local dialects that simply aren’t covered by Google Lens. This is where ChatGPT, particularly GPT-4, has really shone. For example, in Bali, there's a local dialect that Lens just doesn't recognize. I’ve found that feeding text into GPT-4 gives me accurate, context-aware translations, even including some cultural context about idioms or phrases that Google misses entirely.
2. Menu understanding&#x20;

   Food is a huge part of my travel experience, and menus can be an adventure all by themselves. I’ve come across a lot of interesting, handwritten menus that look more like artwork than a list of dishes. Lens often struggles with these, giving awkward or incomplete translations. I’ve taken photos of these menus, transcribed them, and asked ChatGPT to break down what each item actually is. It’s not just about translating the words — it’s about understanding what makes a particular dish unique, what ingredients I should expect, and how it's prepared. Additionally, I've used ChatGPT to identify which dishes are vegetarian-friendly, which is crucial for my girlfriend who follows a vegetarian diet.
3. Landmarks on Train Journeys

   There's something almost magical about train travel, especially in a place as beautiful as Japan or Indonesia. I often find myself staring out of the window, passing small temples, shrines, or bustling street markets. Instead of just wondering what I’m seeing, I’ve been using Perplexity to quickly identify these landmarks and learn about them in real-time. I type in a quick description, or sometimes even upload an image to Google Lens, and I let my AI copilots do the rest. They tell me not just what I’m looking at, but why it matters. It turns a mundane train ride into an impromptu history lesson.

**Bringing the World Closer**

Traveling with AI copilots has been like having a knowledgeable friend with me, someone who not only answers my questions but adds layers of meaning to my experience. Whether it’s understanding the cultural nuances of a menu, deciphering dialects, or enriching my view from a train window, these tools have made my journey deeper, more connected, and definitely more fun.

Have you traveled with an AI copilot? I’d love to hear how you've used technology to enhance your own adventures!
