When I'm not immersed in the world of AI, you'll find me on the Taekwon-Do mat. As a 4th Dan Black Belt and a proud member of the English National Team for many years, Taekwon-Do has been an integral part of my life. This martial art has taught me discipline, perseverance, and the importance of continuous self-improvement – principles that I apply to my professional life as well.

## A Techno-Optimist's Perspective

I'm a firm believer in the power of technological progress. In my view, it's one of the most significant forces shaping our society today. This optimism fuels my passion for AI and drives me to explore its potential in various domains, always with an eye towards creating positive impact.
